# BigSkyEarth_Clustering
This is part of the BigSkyEarth summer school <br \>

this is task02, Clustering.
## Problem description
Given a single high resolution satellite scene, produce the most optimum clustering.

## Approach
We start by applying standard clustering algorithms directly on the image data, this produces a baselline we can later compare against.
The challenge is to design a set of good features to well describe the scene and to improve the clustering by using these features instead of the raw image data.
